Hive Tables
---------------

Internal tables / Managed Tables --> Data gets moved from the HDFS location to the Hive location inside HDFS
============================   and if you drop table, data is permanently lost


External tables  --> Table is mapped into a data location in hdfs, data stays intact abd available for the hadoop processes.


Partitioning
----------------
100 lakh records --> reliance fresh mall
10 lakh --> Blr
	
Select avg(sales)
from table
where city = "Blr"
	
 /Blr --> 10 lakh
/Mum --> 10 lakh
/Del --> 10 lakh

Static Partitioning --> Need to run the insert fcommand for each category of the partition
Dynamic Partitioning --> Dynamically creates the partition for all categories
